1. Attempted to stick to swift coding guidelines
2. MVP and ViewModels used
3. No data Binding as in MVVM
4. Network manager class includes 3 builder classes
    1. URL - Builder
    2. UrlRequest - Builder
    3. URlSession - Builder
5. JSON serialisation is done using Codable and JSONDecoder

ToDo/Couldn't do - due to overlaping time constraints
---
1. Add more unit tests
2. Should have cleaned up Git History
3. Seprate Viewmodel Classes for all screens
4. Clearer Type Seperation instead of using associatedType
5. Base Protocols are empty
6. NetworkManager class is too verbose
7. API constants are added to Networkmanger in an attempt to use Startegy pattern,
    but opted out due to time constraints.
